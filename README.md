# ROBOTICS
Robotics is a rapidly evolving field that promises to transform various industries and aspects of daily life. As technology advances, the capabilities of robots will continue to expand, paving the way for innovative solutions to complex problems.
It combines elements of engineering, computer science, and cognitive psychology to design, build, and operate robots. These machines can be programmed to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously, often in envnments that may be hazardous or difficult for humans to navigate.
Let us then dive into its world where we grab some basics and advanced ideas to design models that has various applications in our daily life.
